# Overview

EasyORM is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that helps developers build applications that interact with databases. It can be used for small-scale applications with a few tables, as well as large-scale enterprise applications. EasyORM is influenced by other ORMs like [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework) .

## **Features**

### **DataMapper pattern**

EasyORM supports the DataMapper pattern, which provides a separation between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application.

### **Entities and Columns**

EasyORM allows you to define entities and columns to map your database tables to Java objects. This makes it easy to work with your database data in your code.

### **Entity Manager**

### **Java Beans as Models**

You can use Java Beans as models in EasyORM, which makes it easy to work with your database data in a way that is familiar to Java developers.

### **Associations (Relations)**

EasyORM supports associations (relations) between entities, which allows you to model complex relationships in your database.

### **Eager and Lazy Loading**

EasyORM supports both eager and lazy loading of data, which allows you to control when data is loaded from the database.

### **Support for Any Kind of SQL Relations**

EasyORM supports any kind of SQL relations, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships.

### **Connection Pooling**

EasyORM supports connection pooling, which allows you to reuse database connections and improve performance.

### **Working with Relational Databases**

EasyORM is designed to work with relational databases, including MySQL, Postgres, and H2 DBMS.

### **Cross-Database and Cross-Schema Queries and Dialect**

EasyORM supports cross-database and cross-schema queries and dialect, which allows you to work with data across different databases.

### **Elegant-Syntax, Flexible, and Powerful Query Builders**

EasyORM provides elegant-syntax, flexible, and powerful query builders, which makes it easy to create complex queries in your code.

### **Proper Pagination for Queries Using Joins**

EasyORM provides proper pagination for queries using joins, which allows you to paginate your data even when using complex queries.

### **Streaming Raw Results**

EasyORM supports streaming raw results, which allows you to work with large amounts of data efficiently.

### **Configuration in JSON**

EasyORM allows you to configure your application using JSON, which makes it easy to manage your application configuration.

### **High-Performance Code**

EasyORM is designed to produce high-performance, flexible, clean, and maintainable code that helps you build efficient and scalable applications.

## **Conclusion**

EasyORM is a powerful ORM framework that provides a range of features to help you build applications that interact with databases. With support for multiple databases, elegant-syntax queries, automatic migrations, and much more, EasyORM is a great choice for developers who want to build clean, efficient, and scalable applications.
